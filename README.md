# Document Scanner using OpenCV and Python
This project demonstrates how to create a simple document scanner using OpenCV and Python. The scanner takes an image of a document, processes it, detects the edges, applies perspective transformations, and outputs a cleaned, scanned version of the document.

Features
1. Edge Detection: Detects the edges of the document in the image.
2. Perspective Transformation: Warps the image to a top-down view of the document.
3. Grayscale Conversion: Converts the document to black and white for a clearer scanned result.
4. Image Thresholding: Applies thresholding to make the document's text stand out.
